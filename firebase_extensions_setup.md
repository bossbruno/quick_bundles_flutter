# Firebase Extensions Setup (No Node.js Required)

## Option 1: Use Firebase Extensions

Instead of writing Node.js code, you can use Firebase's pre-built extensions:

### Step 1: Install the Extension
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Navigate to Extensions
3. Search for "Trigger Email" or "Send FCM notifications"
4. Install the extension

### Step 2: Configure the Extension
- Set up triggers for your Firestore collections
- Configure notification templates
- Set up FCM tokens collection

### Step 3: Update Your Flutter Code
Remove the Cloud Functions calls and let the extension handle everything automatically.

## Option 2: Use Firebase Console Manually
1. Set up FCM in Firebase Console
2. Use Firebase Console to send test notifications
3. Implement only client-side notification handling

## Option 3: Use a Third-Party Service
- OneSignal
- Pushwoosh
- Airship
- These services provide their own SDKs and don't require Node.js

## Option 4: Simplified Implementation
Only implement local notifications (when app is open) without push notifications.
